            *heyyyyy, hello... 
            *I'm cajetan...well Cajetan John,
            *a programmer, just like what you are looking for, or doing, or learning.
            *Well am here coding my time away...you can sit down and watch a few tricks
            *Just like how the supreme beign commanded at it appeared, I follow the same trick.
            *And Cajetan said onto thee "Let there be..."
            *And he 'Cajetan' looked at his creation and saw it was beautiful but far from perfect
            *And so he commanded again ""
            *And now he saw it was beautiful...but as humans aim at a higher achievement, so did he,
            *so on the third attempt he again commanded ""
            *And this he saw was exellent, and was satisfied. So he decided to create a litte inventory about himself
            *and this he did on the right side"
